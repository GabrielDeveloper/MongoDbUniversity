# Homework: Homework 6.1


Write an aggregation query that will determine the number of unique companies with which an individual has been associated. To test that you wrote your aggregation query correctly, from the choices below, select the number of unique companies that Eric Di Benedetto (eric-di-benedetto) has been associated with. I've attached the CrunchBase data set for use in this problem.

```

db.companies.aggregate( [
{ $match: { "relationships.person": { $ne: null } } },
    { $project: { relationships: 1, _id: 0, name:1 } },
    { $unwind: "$relationships" },
    { $group: {
        _id: "$relationships.person",
        name: { $addToSet: "$name" },
        count: { $sum: 1 }
} },
{ $sort: { count: -1 } }] ).pretty();
