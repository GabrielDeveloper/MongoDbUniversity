Suppose we are building a web site that will display companies data in several 
different views. Based on the lessons in this module and ignoring other 
concerns, which of the following conditions favor embedding milestones (as they 
are in the facebook.json example) over maintaining milestones in a separate 
collection. Check all that apply.

Note: Schema design is as much an art as a science. If you get the answer wrong on your first attempt. Please visit the forum to discuss with your fellow students.
