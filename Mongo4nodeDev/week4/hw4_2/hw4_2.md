# Homework: Homework 4.2

````
Suppose you are working with a set of categories defined using the following tree structure. "Science" is a sub-category of "Books"; "Chemistry" and "Physics" are sub-categories of "Science"; and "Classical Mechanics" and "Quantum Mechanics" are sub categories of "Physics".

Books
    Science
        Chemistry
        Physics
            Classical Mechanics
            Quantum Mechanics

For this tree, each node is represented by a document in a collection called categories.

Which of the following schemas will make it possible to find() all descendants of a category using a single query. For example, all descendants of "Science" are "Chemistry", "Physics", "Classical Mechanics", and "Quantum Mechanics".
